				11/04/2021 - Unfortunately, the contents of this website were created under distress, for at the time I was undergoing an acute psychotic episode, product of a condition called 'schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type'.

I still believe in the general ideas I was attempting to convey, and all ideas associated with this communication attempt (eg, the kickstarter, and time machine for peace homepage website), but overall, my ability to do so in an accessible and relatable manner was impaired. I can do better. I am currently in the process of creating a more accessible version of this website and the ideas contained within. For now however, it stands as-is.</p>

				The primary failure in this website's communication attempt was that it does not make it clear that this website is to serve as a template and example, to outline my personal world piece computer for others to 'get the idea' more easily. My intention is to host all my personal efforts and projects (the 'components' of my personal world piece computer') that I dedicate to generating peace in my individual world.

					<h2>Hi! I&rsquo;m Blair.</h2>
					<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
					<p>All I want to do is make new and better life with people.</p>
					<p>I think that the best way to do this is by coming up with ways to include everybody. I think that to make new life, we should collaborate and do art. I think that to make life better, we should do art in a way that helps us solve our hardest problems together.</p>
					<p>In terms of solving our hardest problems, my studies in physics led me to conclude that our hard problems all revolve around the way we think about time&mdash;both the language we use and the ideas we hold on to. Time is (okay fine, <em>effectively</em>) irreversible, and the second law of thermodynamics tells us (it tells me at least) that no matter how much energy we put into solving a hard problem, new and more problems always crop up in its place. (So it really isn&rsquo;t about solving all the problems&hellip;it is more about finding the best way to go about solving new problems, as they crop up in real-time. It is more about asking &lsquo;Is peace a result, or is it more like a process?&rsquo; Process.</p>
					<p>From my perspective, all the hardest problems&mdash;especially social problems&mdash;crop up because we don&rsquo;t have a clear way of making sense of our Human experience, which I believe only makes sense thinking about in the context of <strong>time</strong>.</p>
					<p>So I spend all my time creating a theory of reality to explain and predict Human experience and behavior exclusively in terms of <strong>time</strong>. I want to create a new kind of math/physics-based art that can help us wrap our brains around what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness"><strong>Hard Problem of Consciousness</strong></a>. I want to make it easier for anybody to make more productive sense of this infinitely complex thing we&rsquo;re a part of that we call &rsquo;life'.</p>
					<p><strong>ABOUT MY ART</strong></p>
					<p>My art is <strong>CRUDE</strong> and <strong>UNREFINED</strong>. Conceptual art is a form that places the underlying ideas and concepts above medium and aesthetic refinement. I am first and foremost, trying to communicate complex ideas for the purpose of collaboration en masse.</p>
					<p>The theme I want to emphasize is <strong>world peace</strong>. I think that to solve our hardest problems, we definitely need to figure out how to work together to solve them. No matter what the problem is, if we can&rsquo;t figure out how to cooperate as a species, then we are doomed to fail. World peace is a super loaded term though, and the Kumbaya version that people often think of is extremely unrealistic. This is why I coined the term &lsquo;<strong>universal peace</strong>&rsquo;. Because worlds vary so much within the universe of Human beings, it makes more sense to think about peace in terms of how we can link worlds together in more peaceful ways.</p>
					<p>So my conceptual peace art is to invent a big way to tackle the problem of understanding our experience in terms of time, and to do so in a strictly inclusive way that allows us to connect our worlds together to communicate and come up with ways to make new and better life with everyone involved.</p>

									<p>My only absolute label is my name. I own myself. I&rsquo;m always working, and I&rsquo;m always playing. I live in my own world, and I take frequent vacations to visit other people&rsquo;s worlds; it keeps life fresh. I love sharing and helping. I am a child at soul, and no I do not plan on growing up.</p>

									<h4 class="media-heading">WHY</h4>
									<p>Once I discovered that to meet my needs and wants, I must come up with a way to manage my inner personalities, and the people in my past, present, and future. To accomplish this, I realized I need to invent a time machine. What my time machine does is it allows me to maintain constant communication with the people I need, when I need them most. I need the people in my life&mdash;both living, passed, and future&mdash;as much as I need my various selves.</p>

								</div>
								
								<div class="media-body">
									<h4 class="media-heading">HOW</h4>
									<p>The time machine I invented is called a &lsquo;world piece computer&rsquo;. I use mine to navigate &rsquo;timespace&rsquo;, and my journey is filled with vital experience from the people I observe and interact with. From them, I learn lessons that help direct my present world toward the best future I can find. This establishes what I call my &lsquo;world peace process&rsquo;, thus the principle I value most is that &lsquo;peace is a process, not a result&rsquo;. I enjoy my life by building and operating my world piece computer, and over time this became my deliberate addiction. For the pragmatists, a world piece computer produces a world-specific universal language as a byproduct. This is because worlds overlap, and to ensure peace in a world, individual world piece computers must form networks to maintain the world peace process within intersecting regions.</p>

									<h4 class="media-heading">WHAT</h4>
									<p>My ambition is to create a physical theory of reality that explains our conscious experience exclusively in terms of time&mdash;as an evolving blob of stuff. My mission is to accelerate the technological advent of world peace. Inventing a time machine is the only life-strategy I could come up with that I believe is capable of achieving and accomplishing my ambition and mission. The outcome will be a single network of world piece computers, all sharing a single peace process. This network will be an effective supercomputer formed by interconnected Human brains. By definition, there will be only one supercomputer: The Universal Peace Computer.</p>

						<p>I’m very serious about inventing this time machine; it’s all I care about. You and I might not think of the same thing when we think ‘time machine’, and that’s okay. My version is probably a little more ..abstract. That’s why I use conceptual art as my primary vehicle to network, fundraise, and communicate design plans to people who want to help make the time machine something we can scale and distribute to make things better for our many overlapping worlds.</p>

							<h3><a href="posts/inventedatimemachine.md" target="_blank">Quality &#43; Timespace</a></h3>
						<p>In terms of what matters most to us in our inner worlds, the reality we experience makes sense only in the context of time. This is because the subjective quality of our inner experience relies on comparisons. It feels like &rsquo;this&rsquo;, because it does or does not feel like &rsquo;that&rsquo;. The green of the summer trees are comparably different from the blue of the sky above. To make this comparison is to requires shifting focus between the two qualities, and the two qualities taken together. Even space itself requires time to make sense of distance. We can only determine the distance between objects by taking the time to measure it with a ruler, or a beam of light. This is an irrefutable fact of Human experience. So our experience of time&hellip;well it is actually just the experience of quality in general.</p>

						<p>What a world piece computer does&ndash;what the world peace process does&ndash;is to empower it&rsquo;s operator to methodically travel between the past, present, and future. This travel may be real, or it may be imaginary. The imaginary is usuall a &lsquo;what if&rsquo;. The real is usually a &lsquo;what&rsquo;.</p>

							<h3><a href="posts/inventedatimemachine.md" target="_blank">What&#39;s the point?</a></h3>
						<p>We all naturally invent our own time machines&hellip;our own world piece computers. These are the systems we put in place to manage our stuff. Most of us however, well we don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s actually a time machine that allows us to succeed or fail at living our best lives. Some people&rsquo;s world piece computers work better than others&rsquo;. Those people are who we call &lsquo;successful&rsquo; at whatever it is they set themself toward. People who are successful are rarely just lucky. They usually have some consistent way of managing all the pieces in their world, and this consistency is usually a methodical and systematic process&hellip;like what makes a computer so useful. Even the most non-chalant and free-flowing of successful people are non-chalant and free-flowing in a consistent manner. We all stand to benefit from learning more about how computers work, then applying this knowledge by analogy to our personal lives to get better at processing all the pieces in our worlds.</p>

						<p>The big idea is to empower people to become more methodical and deliberate about their life-systems. I think the best way to do this is to draw from concepts that exist in modern science, mathematics, and technology&hellip;draw from the concepts that have proven to work so well in the outer world&hellip;and use this knowledge to inspire more effective components within an operator&rsquo;s world piece computer. Ultimatelty, a world piece computer time machine is a new type of communication technology.

					<h3>Leadership is overglorified. I am just a lone nut.</h3>
					<p>I&rsquo;m tired of dancing alone and in private, so I&rsquo;m trying to figure out the best way to dance in public so we can do fun and awesome/fulfilling stuff together while inventing a time machine for peace. Basically, I think it would be a blast to spark off a massive epic dance party (figurative (&hellip;someday actual?!?)) with likeminded people across the globe. No need to ask really, just start dancing it out with me. Right now my dance is not so easy to follow, but that&rsquo;s okay because I&rsquo;m always working on improving and I&rsquo;m a quick study. But whatever, following and big-picture stuff aside, I really just wanna do my dance, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gunna do. Let&rsquo;s dance and move in our own ways, but together!</p>

		<p style="font-size:13px; color:black;"> This project is 20+ years in the scheming, 10+ years in the making, with well over $100,000 in direct personal investment, and tens of thousands of hours invested to date. I plan to spend many more tens of thousands of hours working on this project, and I will continue to invest all the money I have into it. None of this would be possible without the immense direct and indirect support from the people in my world, and the privilege of opportunity born from living in the USA, Alaska. If you and I have ever had a conversation longer than 2 minutes, chances are you have contributed to this project without knowing it. Thank you for being.</p>
