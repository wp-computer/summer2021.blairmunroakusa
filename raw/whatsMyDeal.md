What's My Deal?

[light, short]
I've been obsessed with the concepts of worlds, peace, computers, and time since little-boy days. The obsession is fanatic, but I've done a decent job at keeping it under wraps so I can fit into social circles as the 'normal atypical'.

[light, long]
I've always been lost in my own worlds, and definitely out of touch with reality. We can safely point the finger at gameboy, violent books, Apple, and night terrors as the cause for this obsession.

In my transition from youth to adulthood, things did not settle down, they got more intense for me. My obsession went from lowkey to highkey. I bega

So What's My Deal?

I am a creator. Following are 'I am' statements that define my brand of creationism:

ART
.   I am a conceptual peace artist.
v
MASTERPEACE
..  I am an inventor.
..  I am an educator.
..  I am an engineer (electrical by degree).
..  I am a scientist (theoretical physicist by self-study).
..  I am a mathematician (Gaussian manifold by self-identification).
v
GOAL
... I am a diplomat.
... I am a world-builder.
... I am a universal peace advocate.
v
OUTCOME
>>> I am process-oriented.

. ART
I like to think of a piece of conceptual art as an idea defined by a constellation of more primative ideas. The constellation itself transcends media, and a particular installation of conceptual art depends on the surrounding environment, and also on the target audience. The media chosen to represent a conceptual art pieces are chosen on a case-by-case basis. Thus an installation is a representative of the piece itself, and is installed such to most effectively convey the structure and feel of a given idea piece.

Maybe a better way of putting this is that I love creating new worlds with ideas. My primary studio is in my head, where my way of thinking, my demeanor, and my identity tend to be my favorite media. Yes, I live in my own world. And yes, I am usually one step detached from reality. That's because I am always doing art.

.. MASTERPEACE
So in my world I have this masterpiece I've been deliberately pouring myself into for half my life now. It's my obsession. I used to keep it a secret from people, because I didn't good words and expressions to communicate my obsession without being called crazy. Now I have the preparation in place to know that I am not crazy, so it's time to do what I always do and obsess, but this time on exhibit so that other people can help me refine my art as collaborative efforts.

My obsession?

I'm obsessed with creating a theory of reality that explains Human experience exclusively in terms of time (as an evolving blob of stuff). It's all really do in my free time. No matter what I'm doing, I'm usually working in my head. When I'm socializing, I'm mixing my work with play, using my experience with others to inspire my creative process.

Basically, I want to be able to explain subjective Human experience (ie solve The Hard Problem of Consciousness) and I want to be able to predict Human behavior given particular explanations of Human experience in order to harness the Human Condition for the purpose of managing Human Nature. I want to empower people by creating a blueprint that allows them to understand how to get what they want to improve the conditions in their worlds.

The reason I'm obsessed with creating this theory is that I think the coolest problem we have to sink our brains into is the issue of Human cooperation under constant exitential threat from the surrounding worlds and universe. Maybe this is my engineering/physics/math brain. Whatever it is, I love a good problem. The problems I love most are the ones that people take one glance at and say 'unsolvable!' Existential problems in particular hold my attention; our hardest problems we face as Humans are existential. Existential basically means, 'If you don't solve an existential problem, you die.' This may be the death of a physical body or group of bodies, or it may be the death of an individual identity or collective identity. In any case, when people fear for their lives, they stop cooperating and they start killing each other. As I see it, this is a fact and not up for debate.

From my perspective, time is the most fundamental thing. Literally every physical quantity and quality only makes sense in the context of time. Measurements and observations--objective / subjective--inevitably involves a comparison if they are to make any sense. When you compare a thing against a different thing, the only way to do this is to switch focus between things, back and forth, much like a clock. This <> that. Tick <> tock.

But my obsession with time has deeper roots. Ever since little-kid days, I have fixated on the concepts of 'worlds', 'peace', and 'computers'. As it turned out, 'time' is the consistent glue that bonds those concepts together.

Growing up I read a lot. I would frequently pull allnighters as a kid, reading under the blanket so my parents would think I was asleep. 
One of my immense privileges as an affluent American was to be exposed to computers at a very early age.
